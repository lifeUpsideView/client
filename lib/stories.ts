      "Hello and welcome to this episode of true-life stories about how a little girl broke free from near depression.",
      "I wasn’t the typical child who knew exactly what I wanted to be in the future. I loved cooking and baking, but in a Nigerian household, who would settle for being a chef with “all this intelligence” and “good grades”? I never even considered it an option. Instead, I went through the phase of wanting to be like the people around me to feel “normal.” My mom was a teacher, and my dad an accountant, and I was content with settling for either.",
      "In JSS 1, a class where adolescents try to emulate the adults they see on TV shows, especially in an elite secondary school like mine, I was laughed at for not wanting to become a doctor, nurse, or lawyer. I had no desire to be that busy, so I came off as odd among my peers. How could a bright student not have a clear picture of her future? Guidance wasn’t the issue; my parents and teachers were supportive. But I felt like I was being pushed into becoming someone I wasn’t. I wanted to do something I really liked. However, my interests didn’t meet the “standards” elders laid out. I loved photography, drawing, cooking, and reading. I later developed an interest in writing but wasn’t confident enough to share my work. These interests didn’t seem to promise the billions or recognition expected of me, so I started considering architecture.",
      "One fateful day, I developed an excruciating pain in my lower back and was diagnosed with scoliosis, which I call “twisted spine.” This ended my dream of becoming an architect, the one thing I had grown to love. But as they say, “But they plan, and Allah plans, and Allah is the Best of Planners.”",
      "After some much-needed introspection, I considered my remaining options, researched the professions I’d been told would “suit” me, and prayed earnestly for Allah’s guidance. Between reading about my condition and treatments, going for therapy, and observing the white walls of the State House Clinic, I filled in PHARMACY on my JAMB form. After two sittings, I got admission to study pharmacy in my birth town, Sokoto.",
      "Far from home, I began another interesting chapter of my life. By His divine decree, I pulled through. With my reserved nature, I had a hard time settling in and making friends with complete strangers who had different views and habits from what I was used to. This affected my performance. I couldn’t access important resources because I had no one to ask for help and mostly kept to myself. I felt out of place in a state where people held onto familiar faces.",
      "My life in 200 level was one of the most difficult stages of my life. I struggled with feeling left out, the academic workload, and my health. I felt like a walking shell of myself. When I discovered I would have to graduate a year later than my set, it broke the last string holding me together. My course mates would leave me behind, and I’d have to start over with new faces and try harder to survive or risk getting kicked out. I started working on autopilot, became even more reserved, and lost too much weight. This garnered unnecessary attention. My now senior colleagues, some lecturers, and friends tried to help me, but I thought they were overreacting and that I had it under control until my family members did their best to snap me out of it.",
      "Alhamdulillah, I picked myself up, brushed off the invisible dust weighing heavily on my shoulders, and prayed to Allah for His help and mercy. I am forever grateful for going through that phase because it brought amazing people into my life and, most importantly, brought me closer to Allah, providing a permanent fix.",
      "I graduated after seven years of pharmacy school, thanks to strikes and my additional year. I couldn’t be more grateful to my Lord, my family, and my small circle.",
      "The worst thing that can happen to a person is losing faith. Take it from someone who experienced the bitterness of being out of touch and re-experienced the sweetness of rekindling that feeling of connection. “Do not lose hope in the mercy of Allah.” Fully submit to Him, and He will make your life everything and more than you can ever dream of.",

      "Today, I share a heart-wrenching story about Mr. A, a man whose life was tragically halted in its tracks. Imagine this: you’re on your way home from a heartwarming trip visiting family, full of life and stories to tell. That was Mr. A, heading back to Nigeria from Gabon, after seeing his mother. But then, in a blink of an eye, everything changed.",
      "In a catastrophic accident, he emerged as the lone survivor, yet bound by a spinal injury that rendered him immobile from the waist down. The physical trauma was immense, but the emotional toll was even more profound. Transitioning to a life constrained to a wheelchair wasn’t easy. He faced the reality of his new normal, with his own inner strength as his main support.",
      "Mr. A’s mother enveloped him with love and unwavering care during his initial years of rehabilitation. The responsibility, however, became a towering challenge. With a heavy heart, she made the grueling decision to send him to live with his father, drawn by the faint hope of a better life for her son.",
      "In the quiet spaces of his new existence, Mr. A discovered solace in the pages of Islamic books. Through diligence and perseverance, he wasn’t just assimilating knowledge; he was preparing to impart it.",
      "He blossomed into a respected teacher and a pillar of the community, inspiring many with his teachings and unwavering faith.",
      "Entrepreneurship wasn’t off the table either. He proved his mettle by starting a business, right from the confines of his home, a testament to his belief that a physical disability could not dampen mental fortitude. In time, his small enterprise flourished, becoming the breadbasket for his dependents, whom he fed and clothed for years.",
      "His parenting style was nothing short of extraordinary. He raised his youngest son with a firm hand, ensuring the boy grew up with solid moral values. Mr. A’s story isn’t just about overcoming disability; it’s about being an unwavering beacon for his family.",
      "As he aged, even after the loss of both parents, he continued to be the caregiver—this time for his grandmother. Mr. A was living proof that life’s worth isn’t measured by the physical strides we can take, but by the leaps of faith, love, and sheer determination.",
      "While Mr. A’s story is one of personal triumph against bit-part adversities, it doesn’t shy away from looming tragedies yet to unfold. The neglect he faced in his last days is a sharp contrast to the resilience he demonstrated throughout his life. The tale that follows is not just a continuation but a stark exposition of a system that failed a man of such indomitable spirit.",
      "Today, I share with you the final chapter in Mr. A’s extraordinary story, a conclusion that’s as sobering as it is thought-provoking. A week before his untimely passing, Mr. A faced a new, grim adversary: a relentless medical condition that seemed to mock his well-known resilience. Despite the urgency, his cries for help went unheeded for three long days in a hospital where timely care was sadly not on the docket.",
      "The pained question that haunts us is what truly led to Mr. A’s death. Was it the delay in medical attention, the doctor’s oversight, or the broader issues plaguing Nigeria’s healthcare system? While we may never hold a definitive answer, one thing is crystal clear: it was a cascade of failures that ultimately failed a man of such fortified spirit.",
      "In the wake of Mr. A’s passing, we’re left to reflect on the indelible mark he imprinted on the world around him. His unwavering determination and his relentless passion for life became a beacon of hope for many. Through his teachings, his kindness, and his entrepreneurial spirit, he educated and inspired a community that revered him.",
      "His story, as devastating as it is, sheds light on a stark reality – the necessity for substantial improvements in medical care and support systems for people with disabilities. Mr. A’s life serves as both a powerful testament to human resilience and a glaring illustration of the perilous consequences when care and compassion are in short supply.",
      "We owe it to Mr. A and to the countless individuals like him to take up the banner of advocacy for better healthcare. It’s not just about honoring his legacy, but it’s also about acknowledging the intrinsic value of every person and ensuring they receive the care they deserve.",
      "So as we bid farewell to Mr. A, let’s not allow his story to be a mere whisper into the void. Let it be the clarion call that spurs us to action, honoring a man whose courage and influence refuse to be extinguished. Rest in peace, Mr. A – your strength, defiance, and impact will echo through time.",

      "For the sake of this story, I’ll call my late cousin “A.” She was more than a cousin to me—she was my sister, my confidant, and my dearest friend. A grew up in Maiduguri with her parents, siblings, and step-siblings, all living together in a large family house.",
      "Despite coming from a big family, A possessed a quiet strength and serenity that left an indelible impression on everyone she met. Life for her was never easy; she was born with sickle cell disease, and the cruel cycle of crises became her constant companion. Barely a month would pass without her enduring another painful episode.",
      "Yet in the midst of her suffering, A remained incredibly strong. She was a kind, caring, and deeply loving person who never let her illness darken her spirit. She never quarreled or fought with anyone; instead, she always extended kindness and patience, even during the most challenging times.",
      "A found joy in life’s simple pleasures—losing herself in the words of the Quran, reading books, and relaxing with movies that allowed her to escape, if only for a little while. She had dreams, too. She yearned to attend university, but despite finishing secondary school long before I even began mine, she faced years of frustration trying to gain admission.",
      "Together with her mother, A tried every treatment available—both medicinal and Islamic remedies—but nothing seemed to ease her suffering. For a long time, she harbored one particular wish: to visit her aunt in Abuja. She would often plead with her mom to let her go for just a few weeks, but her mom, out of concern, would hesitate—fearing that A would become a burden if she had a crisis while staying there. Eventually, after years of gentle pleading, her mother agreed. A was ecstatic; for her, this trip symbolized a freedom she rarely experienced.",
      "The day before her journey, A was struck with an intense crisis. She called me, asking me to come over. When I arrived, she whispered that she was in terrible pain and asked if I had any painkillers, wanting to hide her condition from her mom so she wouldn’t be stopped from going. I could see the determination in her eyes as she tried to push through the agony for a chance at this trip.",
      "A traveled to Kaduna the next day, but her condition worsened after standing in the rain. Once she stabilized, her aunt insisted she continue to Abuja, where she would be more comfortable and better looked after. Soon after arriving, another crisis struck, and she was hospitalized. Tests were run, some results came back, while others were pending. She was discharged and stayed at her brother’s house to recover. Her mother kept urging her to return home to Maiduguri, but A wasn’t stable enough to travel.",
      "The crises returned with unrelenting force. She was readmitted to the hospital, and the remaining test results revealed devastating news: her platelet levels were dangerously high, putting her at extreme risk of stroke. The doctors warned her brother that she could suffer a stroke at any moment. But A, ever the warrior, fought her way back to health once more and was discharged on a Friday. Her flight back to Maiduguri was booked for the following Tuesday, and she eagerly looked forward to going home, filled with a new lightness and joy.",
      "On Monday, A spent most of the day resting. She slept deeply, as if gathering strength, and kept to her room. Later that evening, her sister-in-law went to check on her, only to find A unresponsive. She called her husband, and together they rushed A to the hospital. Her aunt was notified, and so were we. We all anxiously waited for news, hoping against hope. But despite every attempt to resuscitate her, A’s battle was finally over. We lost her that day. She slipped away, leaving us with a silence we could not fathom.",
      "When I arrived at the hospital, there lay my sister—my beloved cousin, A—her body cold, lifeless. Touching her hand, I could feel the chill of death slowly spreading, and a numb disbelief gripped me. How could this beautiful soul, so vibrant with life and resilience, now be reduced to what they called “the body”? My world shattered at that moment. It didn’t feel real until they carried her to her final resting place and returned without her.",
      "We lost A in 2017, yet it feels like only yesterday. Her memory lingers, forever fresh, like an ache that never quite heals. I often find myself mourning her, crying for the pain she endured and the battles she faced. Yet through my grief, I find comfort in knowing she is now free from pain, in a better place where suffering cannot touch her.",
      "The upside, if one can be found in such profound loss, lies in the lasting impact she made on all who knew her. A’s legacy lives on in the quiet strength she showed us, in the kindness she extended even in her darkest moments, and in the way she taught us to face life’s challenges with grace and resilience.",
      "Her story reminds us that true strength often comes wrapped in gentleness, and that even in the midst of great suffering, one can still touch others’ lives with love and light. While A may be gone, her spirit continues to inspire and guide those who knew her, showing us that even the briefest of lives can leave an eternal impact on the hearts they’ve touched.",
